                <div class="feedback">&emsp;As Aliaksandr Suzen's teammate at Allot for the past 9 months, I've benefited from his
                    creative
                    problem-solving,
                    tireless work ethic, and willingness to do whatever it takes to solve problems.
                    Aliaksandr is directly responsible for increasing the automated testing using python and helping to
                    jump
                    to
                    Kubernetes from a non containerized environment thanks to his knowledge
                    As a colleague, Aliaksandr is incredibly generous with his time and expertise, which includes
                    everything
                    from a
                    year and a half of python experience to an expert-level knowledge of Kubernetes. Beyond that, as his
                    co-worker,
                    I have to say that his humor and dedication makes work effortless and safe.
                    I'd be glad to answer any questions you might have about his specific skills and experience.

                <div class="feedback">&emsp;Aliaksandr Suzen has worked with us for about a year.
                    His goals on the team were to help with the transformation of the automation(python) to K8s
                    environment and to
                    increase the coverage of automated test cases and its corresponding validation. Without his
                    technical help this
                    would not have been possible.
                    Aliaksandr Suzen demonstrates great programming skills by completing the tasks assigned for the
                    overall
                    objective on time.
                    He works autonomously and effectively. He asks pertinent questions having previously analyzed the
                    problem.
                    The product where we worked on is a big and relatively complex because the maturity level. He has
                    acquired
                    sufficient knowledge to work with it in a short time and autonomously.
                    The treatment has always been very friendly. It helps to have a good atmosphere in the team. He
                    proactively
                    shares his knowledge or new ideas with other team members when needed. Good team worker.

                <div class="feedback">&emsp;I have been working with Alex for over a year. During this time, he showed
                    himself
                    as a
                    responsible, patient and always ready to help person. If a question arises in any direction such as
                    python or
                    kubernetes or a topic that is unknown to him, he tries to help find the answer. I also see him as a
                    hardworking
                    person. He often goes home much later than the others. Alex is very sociable and no one had any
                    problems
                    communicating with him. Such a person is often missing in the team.</div>

                <div class="feedback">&emsp;Despite having had Aliaksandr as a teammate for only a few months, I have
                    had enough time to be sure that he is an excellent teammate and a hard worker who carries out his
                    tasks with diligence and commitment.
                    In addition to his role in the QA team, we have both collaborated in the development of internal
                    tools for our team, where he has been a key player in their improvement and evolution.
                    Even more important is the fact that despite the distances and characteristics of remote work,
                    Aliaksandr has been one of the team showing great empathy and ability to contribute to the team with
                    autonomy and his own ideas.</div>
